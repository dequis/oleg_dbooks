Twitter markov thing for OlegDB.

Generating Corpus
-----------------

I scraped all of the feeds I wanted by hand with chrome and just saved them in a
file. Then:

````
./prepare_html.sh
./prepare_step2.py && wc -l prepared3.txt && cat prepared3.txt | sort | uniq > prepared4.txt
cp prepared4.txt redone_final.txt
````

`hashtags.txt` was generated with the following:

```bash
grep -o '#\w\+' prepared2.html | sort | uniq -c | sort -g -r > hashtags.txt
````

Running
-------

You'll need to put your sick twitter creds in `local_settings.py`. Then you can
just run `main.py` and it'll tweet for you. If you just want to see some example
output, set `debug=True` in `main.py` and it'll print what it wants to tweet.

What is it?
-----------

This is a twitter bot designed to market OlegDB in the best way we know how: By
generating markov text from the tweets of other database projects! You can see
the corpus in `redone_final.txt`.
